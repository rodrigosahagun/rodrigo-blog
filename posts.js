    "summary": "Change fails more often because of role imbalance than strategy. Dr. Adizes' PAEI model shows why.",
    "content": "<p>Every leader I’ve met agrees: <em>change is hard</em>. But few stop to ask why change initiatives fail — even when the strategy is solid and resources are available.</p>\n<p>Across enterprises and startups, I see a pattern: leaders fail not for lack of vision, but due to imbalance in their managerial roles.</p>\n<h3>The 4 Roles Every Leader Must Balance (PAEI)</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>P – Producer:</strong> results & execution</li>\n  <li><strong>A – Administrator:</strong> order & process</li>\n  <li><strong>E – Entrepreneur:</strong> vision & innovation</li>\n  <li><strong>I – Integrator:</strong> trust & collaboration</li>\n</ul>\n<p>No single leader excels at all four. When change hits, gaps show: too much P blinds you to tomorrow; too much A breeds bureaucracy; too much E creates chaos; too much I slows action.</p>\n<p>Successful change doesn’t demand perfection in one person — it demands a complementary team where P, A, E and I are present and respected.</p>\n<p>I learned this the hard way: I was leaning on E and neglecting A. Admitting that changed how I build teams and partner.</p>\n<h3>Food for Thought</h3>\n<p>Which role do you over‑rely on? Who complements your gaps? What would shift if PAEI were intentionally balanced in your next transformation?</p>"
