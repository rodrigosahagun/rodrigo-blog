    "content": "<p>Every leader I’ve met agrees: <em>change is hard</em>. But few stop to ask why change initiatives fail — even when the strategy is solid and resources are available.</p>\n<p>Across enterprises and startups, I see a pattern: leaders fail not for lack of vision, but due to imbalance in their managerial roles.</p>\n<h3>The 4 Roles Every Leader Must Balance (PAEI)</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>P – Producer:</strong> results & execution</li>\n  <li><strong>A – Administrator:</strong> order & process</li>\n  <li><strong>E – Entrepreneur:</strong> vision & innovation</li>\n  <li><strong>I – Integrator:</strong> trust & collaboration</li>\n</ul>\n<p>No single leader excels at all four. When change hits, gaps show: too much P blinds you to tomorrow; too much A breeds bureaucracy; too much E creates chaos; too much I slows action.</p>\n<p>Successful change doesn’t demand perfection in one person — it demands a complementary team where P, A, E and I are present and respected.</p>\n<p>I learned this the hard way: I was leaning on E and neglecting A. Admitting that changed how I build teams and partner.</p>\n<h3>Food for Thought</h3>\n<p>Which role do you over‑rely on? Who complements your gaps? What would shift if PAEI were intentionally balanced in your next transformation?</p>"

  summary: "A practical 3-step hiring framework—Values, Basic Hard Skills, then Soft Skills—to match the right person to the right role.",
  content: "<h1>Hire Right in 3 Steps: Values → Hard Skills → Soft Skills</h1><p><strong>Short answer:</strong> start with values, verify basic hard skills, and then assess soft skills. In that order.</p><h2>Why this order matters</h2><p>Most mis-hires don’t fail because the person lacks raw talent. They fail because the sequence is wrong. If you skip values or over-index on shiny hard skills, you may hire a capable person who won’t thrive in your culture or role.</p><h2>Step 1 — Values (non-negotiable)</h2><p><strong>Goal:</strong> ensure the candidate genuinely shares your organization’s values and ways of working.</p><ul><li><strong>Operationalize values:</strong> translate each value into observable behaviors (e.g., “We own outcomes” → brings closure, shares learnings, takes responsibility).</li><li><strong>Screening prompts:</strong> “Tell me about a time you made a mistake and how you handled it.” “When did you last push back on a popular decision?”</li><li><strong>Red flags:</strong> vague answers, blaming language, inconsistency between examples and references.</li></ul><h2>Step 2 — Basic Hard Skills (role essentials)</h2><p><strong>Goal:</strong> verify only the skills critical to perform <em>this</em> role in the next 3–6 months.</p><ul><li><strong>Define the minimum bar:</strong> list 3–5 must-have capabilities (e.g., intermediate Excel, industry regulation basics, CRM execution).</li><li><strong>Use practical tests:</strong> a short take-home or live exercise mirroring the job (30–60 minutes). Score with a rubric.</li><li><strong>Beware of “expert everywhere” bias:</strong> you don’t need a CFA for every finance role; hire for the <em>current</em> problem set.</li></ul><h2>Step 3 — Soft Skills (motivation & style)</h2><p><strong>Goal:</strong> understand what drives the person, their collaboration style, and where they do their best work.</p><ul><li><strong>Motivators:</strong> ask what gives them energy and what drains them; look for role-fit patterns.</li><li><strong>Communication & collaboration:</strong> conflict examples, feedback stories, cross-functional wins.</li><li><strong>Role–style fit (Adizes PAEI):</strong> different roles require different dominant styles—<em>P</em> (Producer) for execution, <em>A</em> (Administrator) for order, <em>E</em> (Entrepreneur) for innovation, <em>I</em> (Integrator) for trust and culture. Aim for a complementary team, not a “perfect” individual.</li></ul><h2>Common mistakes to avoid</h2><ul><li><strong>Wrong sequence:</strong> hiring on charisma/hard skills before validating values.</li><li><strong>Pedigree over proof:</strong> brands on a résumé aren’t the same as capability for your context.</li><li><strong>Endless processes:</strong> long funnels exhaust great candidates; keep it rigorous, not bloated.</li></ul><h2>Mini scorecard (copy/paste)</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Criterion</th><th>Evidence</th><th>Rating (1–5)</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Values alignment</td><td>Behavioral examples + references</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Hard skills (role essentials)</td><td>Exercise rubric</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Soft skills</td><td>Motivation, collaboration, conflict</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Role–style fit (PAEI)</td><td>Team complementarity</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>How ALIS helps (Adizes Leadership Indicators Suite)</h2><p><strong>ALIS</strong> supports hiring by aligning values, skills, and leadership styles. It provides:</p><ul><li><strong>Structured prompts</strong> to test values with behavior-based questions.</li><li><strong>Role requirement mapping</strong> to define only the hard skills that matter now.</li><li><strong>Style indicators</strong> to identify PAEI tendencies and complement your existing team.</li></ul><p>Used together, these tools reduce bias, accelerate consensus, and raise the probability of long-term success.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Do I really need tests for hard skills?</h3><p>Short, job-relevant exercises predict performance better than interviews alone—and they’re fairer to non-traditional backgrounds.</p><h3>What if a candidate fits our values but lacks a skill?</h3><p>Hire for values and coachable gaps; avoid gaps that will block performance in the next 3–6 months.</p><h3>How do I spot values misalignment early?</h3><p>Ask for specific, recent examples; probe for trade-offs; check references for behavior under pressure.</p><h3>Can one person be strong in all PAEI roles?</h3><p>Unlikely. Build a complementary leadership team instead of expecting one “perfect” hire.</p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Values first, role-critical hard skills second, soft skills third. In that order. If you want a template or a deeper diagnostic, reach out—I’m happy to share how ALIS fits your context.</p>"
